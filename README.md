# Demo

# Purpose

This project aimed to use JQuery to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model). I used JQuery, leading to more concise javascript code to manipulate the DOM. This project uses the **open library API** to retrieve images from a book's title. You can add, edit and delete books from your library which are stored in local storage.

# Contents

This project has 3 files.

1. index.html - The landing page for the project.

2. styles.css - Styling for the webpage.

3. script.js - Functions to retrieve book information through API calls and to handle local storage.
